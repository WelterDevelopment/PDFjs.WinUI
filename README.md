# PDFjs.WinUI

This is a WebView2-based wrapper of PDF.js for WinUI 3 / WinAppSDK. It is optimized to be used for PDF files generated by TeX.

## Features

- Open a PDF file (StorageFile)
- Change the Theme (Light/Dark)
- viewer.css has been tweaked to show Win11-styled scrollbars (adapting to the theme)
- viewer.html and viewer.js have been tweaked to automatically show the outline instead of thumbnails.

## ToDo

- SyncTeX functionality (scroll to a specific position; listen to double-click events)
- Implement two-way bindable properties (current page)
